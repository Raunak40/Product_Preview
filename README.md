## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge I learned about letter-spacing, letter-height and word-spacing.
Here I also used a little bit of flexbox property where I learned that browsers have a default flexbox shrink value of 1.I used some semantic HTML tags and also understood the importance of Mobile-first workflow.

### Continued development

There are so many things which I have to continue learning like responsiveness, flexbox and media queries. I am still amature in these fields so I will continue developing them and improve this webpage later.I will also try to learn more semantic HTML tags and efficiently use them.

I'd recommend it to anyone who is learning this concept.
